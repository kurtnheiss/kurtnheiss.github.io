# Dad Jokes API Overview

A dad joke is a type of humor characterized by its simplicity, which often facilitates the creation of groan-inducing puns, wordplay, or cheesy humor. They're typically light-hearted and harmless, often delivered by fathers to their children which confers the naming of the joke as a "dad joke."

For example:
  "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"

They're not always meant to be knee-slappingly funny but are more about eliciting a chuckle or an eye-roll from the audience.
